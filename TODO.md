# Todo - app

&#x2611; Use session to get data

&#x2611; Redirect for session

&#x2611; Update goals

&#x2611; Associate events with goals

&#x2611; Add roles to profile page 

&#x2611; Fix next auth initialization to fix deploy

&#x2611; Own table

&#x2610; Visualize events better

&#x2610; Refetch events when one is created (reactQuery?)

&#x2610; Add goals and mission statement to calendar again.

&#x2610; Reconsider data fetching, add a loading state client side. So slow now.

&#x2610; Fetch calendar events more efficent, don't get them all (POKEMON)
